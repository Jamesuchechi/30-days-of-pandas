Quest

Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]

 

Constraints:

    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= n

 

Follow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
    flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
    There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
    0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

Table: Tweets

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| tweet_id       | int     |
| content        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
content consists of alphanumeric characters, '!', or ' ' and no other special characters.
This table contains all the tweets in a social media app.

 

Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. The tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Tweets table:
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| tweet_id | content                           |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| 1        | Let us Code                       |
| 2        | More than fifteen chars are here! |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
Output: 
+----------+
| tweet_id |
+----------+
| 2        |
+----------+
Explanation: 
Tweet 1 has length = 11. It is a valid tweet.
Tweet 2 has length = 33. It is an invalid tweet.

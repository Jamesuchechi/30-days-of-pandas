Given a string s and an integer k, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.

Example 3:

Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s consists of lowercase English letters.
    1 <= k <= s.length

 class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

 

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

    "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
    "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
    "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.

The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+
Output: 
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Low Salary: Account 2.
Average Salary: No accounts.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.


Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |

SQL

A country is big if:

    it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
    it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).

Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |

Leetcode general problems

There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

 

Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

Example 2:

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

Example 3:

Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]

 

Constraints:

    n == candies.length
    2 <= n <= 100
    1 <= candies[i] <= 100
    1 <= extraCandies <= 50

class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        

QUEST

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

 

Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 500
    0 <= nums[i] <= 100


class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

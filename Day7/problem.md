LEETCODE

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 104
    s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
    There is at least one word in s.

 

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

Table: Users

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.

 

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+
Output: 
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

import pandas as pd

def order_scores(scores: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.

 

Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

    The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
    If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
    After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Scores table:
+----+-------+
| id | score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+-------+------+
| score | rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |

 leetcode

 You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

 

Constraints:

    n == height.length
    2 <= n <= 105
    0 <= height[i] <= 104

 class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:

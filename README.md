🚀 30 Days LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my 30 Days LeetCode Challenge!
This repository tracks my daily progress as I solve algorithm and data-structure problems to sharpen my coding, problem-solving, and technical interview skills.

🎯 Challenge Goal

Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day for 30 consecutive days, focusing on:

Data Structures

Algorithms

Problem-solving patterns

Time & space optimization

Clean, readable code

🧠 Why This Challenge?

Consistency beats intensity.
By solving problems daily, I aim to:

Strengthen my fundamentals

Master common interview patterns

Improve speed and accuracy

Become better prepared for real-world technical interviews

Build a strong portfolio of solutions

📅 Daily Structure

For each day, I document:

✔️ Problem Title

💡 Approach / Idea

🧮 Time & Space Complexity

🧑‍💻 Solution Code

📝 Notes / Insights
